    Here's a list of tools you'll need to install for building and deploying a Teams app.

    | &nbsp; | Install | For using... |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Required** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
    | &nbsp; | [Visual Studio 2019](https://visualstudio.com/download), **ASP.NET and web development**, or **.NET Core cross-platform development** workload | .NET. You can install the free community edition of Visual Studio 2019. |
    | &nbsp; | [Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads) | Sample C# app repo from GitHub |
    | &nbsp; | [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/download) | Teams app features (conversational bots, messaging extensions, and incoming webhooks) require inbound connections. You need to expose your development system to Teams through a tunnel. A tunnel is not required for apps that only include tabs. This package is installed within the project directory (using npm `devDependencies`). |
    | **Optional** | &nbsp; | &nbsp; |
    | &nbsp; | [Azure Tools for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode.vscode-node-azure-pack) and [Azure CLI](/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) | Azure tools to access stored data or to deploy a cloud-based backend for your Teams app in Azure. |
    | &nbsp; | [Developer Portal for Teams](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/) | Web-based portal to configure, manage, and distribute your Teams app including to your organization or the Teams store. |

    ## Verify git installation

    If Visual Studio installation prompts you to add `git` to the path, select it. 
    In a terminal window, run the following command to verify the `git` installation:

    ```bash
    $ git --version
    git version 2.17.1.windows.2

    ```

    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

    ### Enable sideloading option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.
      
    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If Teams doesn't show the option to upload a custom app, talk to your Teams administrator.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
    1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.png" alt-text="Example of what you see after signing up for the Microsoft 365 developer program.":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

    ## Get a free Azure account

    If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

    Now you’ve got all tools and set up your accounts. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building!

    > [!NOTE]
    > Use a suitable terminal window on your platform. These examples use Git Bash but can be run on most platforms.

    Open the latest version of Visual Studio and install any updates.

    You can use the same terminal window to run the commands in this tutorial.

    <a name="DownloadSample"></a>

    ## Download the sample

    You can get started with a [Hello, World!](https://github.com/OfficeDev/Microsoft-Teams-Samples/tree/main/samples/app-hello-world/csharp) sample in C#. To use this sample, clone the sample repo in one of the following ways:

    After you've cloned the repo for C# sample app, you can build and run the app in your local environment.

    In this page, you'll learn to:
    1. [Build your first app](#build-your-first-app)
    1. [Deploy your sample app locally](#deploy-your-sample-app-locally)

    ## Build your first app

    You can view the project structure in the **Solution Explorer** after the workspace is created. Now, you're to build and run your app.

    **To build and run the cloned sample**

    1. Open the solution file **Microsoft.Teams.Samples.HelloWorld.sln** from the **Microsoft-Teams-Samples/samples/app-hello-world/csharp** directory of the sample.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/hello-world-sln-open.png" alt-text="Image showing Hello World solution directory structure" border="false":::

        - `https://localhost:3333/second`

            :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/local-host-second-tab.png" alt-text="Image showing second tab of the app" border="false":::

        > [!Note]
        > If you receive an error `Could not find a part of the path … bin\roslyn\csc.exe`, update the package with the command `Update-Package Microsoft.CodeDom.Providers.DotNetCompilerPlatform -r`.

    ## Deploy your sample app locally

    Microsoft Teams apps are web applications that provide one or more capabilities. Make your app available on the internet so that the Teams platform can load it. Host your app using `ngrok` to create a tunnel to the local process on your computer.

    After you host your app, make a note of its root URL, such as `https://yourteamsapp.ngrok.io` or `https://yourteamsapp.azurewebsites.net`.

    ### Tunnel using ngrok

    After you install ngrok, you can create a tunnel to deploy your app locally:

    1. Open a new terminal window.
    1. Run the following command to create a tunnel. The sample app uses port 3333.

        ```bash
        ngrok http 3333 -host-header=localhost:3333
        ````
        The ngrok tunnel is created. Here's an example:

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/csharp-ngrok-tunnel.png" alt-text="Image showing ngrok tunnel" border="false":::

        *Ngrok* listens to requests from the internet and will route them to your app running on port 3333.

    To verify the app's local deployment:

    1. Open the browser.
    1. Load your app using the following URL:

        `https://<forwarding address in ngrok console session>/hello`

        Here's an example of the URL:

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/csharp-ngrok-verify-tunnel.png" alt-text="Image showing C# app running locally on ngrok tunnel" border="false":::

    1. Make a note of the forwarding address in ngrok console. You need this URL to deploy your app in teams.

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you've used a different port during [build](#build-your-first-app), ensure you use the same port number to setup the `ngrok` tunnel.
        > [!TIP]
        > It's a good idea to run `ngrok` in a different terminal window. It helps to keep `ngrok` from interfering with the app, when you'll need to stop, rebuild, and rerun the app. The `ngrok` session provides useful debugging information in this window.

        The app is available only during the current session on your computer. It isn't available if the machine is shut down or goes to sleep. If you restart the service, the app returns a new address. Then, update every location using the old address with the new one. Remember to do this step when you share the app for testing.

        The paid version of `ngrok` doesn't have this limitation.

- title: Configure your first C# app using Dev Portal
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    After you build and test your Teams app, you can test it using Developer Portal.

    In this page, you'll learn to [configure the app package in Developer Portal](#configure-the-app-package-in-developer-portal).

    ## Publish option in Visual Studio 2019

    Microsoft Azure hosts your .NET application on a free tier. It uses shared infrastructure that is sufficient to run the `Hello World` sample. For more information, see [creating a new free Azure account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/).

    Visual Studio 2019 has built-in support for app deployment to different providers, including Azure:

    :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/publish-to-azure.png" alt-text="Image showing the Publish to Azure menu item in Visual Studio 2019" border="false":::

    ## Configure the app package in Developer Portal

    You can use [Developer Portal](https://dev.teams.microsoft.com/) to configure the app package and its capabilities. Developer Portal is a Teams app that simplifies the creation and registration of an app. Install from the Teams store!

    Configuring the app package includes:

    1. [Importing the app package to Developer Portal](#import-the-app-package-in-developer-portal)

        The manifest file appears on the right pane.

        :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/app-manifest-dev-portal.png" alt-text="Image showing App manifest file in Developer Portal" border="false":::

    ### Configure your app capabilities

    After you've imported your app into Developer Portal, the next step is to configure app capabilities. Developer Portal contains all the app information in different sections. It makes configuring the app capabilities easy.

    Using Developer Portal, you can:
    - [Configure personal tab app](#configure-personal-tab-app)
    - [Configure bot](#configure-bot)
    - [Configure message extension](#configure-message-extension)

    #### Configure personal tab app

    To configure personal tab app:

    1. Select the :::image type="icon" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/ellipse-icon.png"::: icon on the **Personal app** card on the **App features** pane, and select **Edit**.

        The details for Hello tab appear.
