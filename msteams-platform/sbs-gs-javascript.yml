    ## Prepare development environment

    After you've installed the required tools, set up the development environment.


    ### Install the Teams Toolkit

    The Teams Toolkit helps simplify the development process with tools to provision and deploy cloud resources for your app, publish to the Teams store, and more. 
    
    You can use the toolkit with Visual Studio Code, or CLI (command-line interface), called `TeamsFx`.


    # [Visual Studio Code](#tab/vscode)

    1. Open Visual Studio Code and select the **Extensions** view (**Ctrl+Shift+X** / **⌘⇧-X** or **View > Extensions**).
    1. In the search box, enter **Teams Toolkit**.
    1. Select **Install** next to the Teams Toolkit.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/install-toolkit-vscode.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit extension installation." border="false":::

        The Teams Toolkit icon appears in the Visual Studio Code sidebar after it's installed.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/hw-teams-toolkit-sidebar-icon.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the Teams Toolkit icon in Visual Studio Code sidebar." border="false":::

    You also can find the Teams Toolkit on the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=TeamsDevApp.ms-teams-vscode-extension).

    # [Command line](#tab/cli)

    To install the TeamsFx CLI, use the `npm` package manager:

    ``` bash
    npm install -g @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```

    Depending on your configuration, you may need to use `sudo` to install the CLI:

    ``` bash
    sudo npm install -g --unsafe-perm @microsoft/teamsfx-cli
    ```

    This condition is more common on Linux and macOS systems.

    Ensure you add the npm global cache to your PATH. This step is normally done as part of the Node.js installer.  

    You can use the CLI with the `teamsfx` command. Verify that the command is working by running `teamsfx -h`.

    > [!CAUTION]
    > Before you can run TeamsFx in PowerShell terminals, you must enable the "remote signed" execution policy for PowerShell. For more information about it, see the [PowerShell documentation](/powershell/module/microsoft.powershell.core/about/about_signing).

    ## Set up your Teams development tenant

    A **tenant** is like a space, or a container for your organization in Teams, where you chat, share files, and run meetings. This space is also where you sideload and test your app. Let's verify if you're ready to develop with the tenant.

    ### Enable sideloading option

    After creating the app, you must load your app in Teams without distributing it. This process is known as sideloading. Sign in to your Microsoft 365 account to view this option.
      
    Do you already have a tenant, and do you have the admin access? Let's check if you really do!

    Verify if you can sideload apps in Teams:

    1. In the Teams client, select **Store** icon.
    1. Select **Manage your apps**.
    1. Look for the option to **Upload a custom app**. If you see the option, sideloading apps is enabled.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/prerequisites/upload-custom-app.png" alt-text="Illustration shows the option to upload a custom app in Teams.":::

        > [!NOTE]
        > If you don't have the option to upload a custom app, talk to your Teams administrator.

    ### Create a free Teams developer tenant (optional)

    If you don't have a Teams developer account, you can get it free. Join the Microsoft 365 developer program!

    1. Go to the [Microsoft 365 developer program](https://developer.microsoft.com/microsoft-365/dev-program).
    1. Select **Join Now** and follow the onscreen instructions.
    1. In the welcome screen, select **Set up E5 subscription**.
    1. Set up your administrator account. After you finish, the following screen appears.

        :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/build-your-first-app/dev-program-subscription.png" alt-text="Example of what you see after signing up for the Microsoft 365 developer program.":::

    1. Sign in to Teams using the administrator account you just set up. Verify that you have the **Upload a custom app** option in Teams.

    ## Get a free Azure account

    If you wish to host your app or access resources in Azure, you must have an Azure subscription. [Create a free account](https://azure.microsoft.com/free/) before you begin.

    Now you’ve got all tools and set up your account. Next, let's set up your development environment and start building!

- title: Create project workspace for your tab app

    ## Take a tour of the source code

    Teams Toolkit provides all components for building an app. After creating the project, you can view the project folders and files in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code.

    :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/hw-folder-structure.png" alt-text="Project files scaffolded for the app with Tab capability in Visual Studio Code.":::

    Although you're free to choose any UI framework (or not to use any), this sample template code provides a scaffolding with React components.

    Among other items in this directory structure, the Toolkit maintains:

    - `.fx`: The state for your app in this folder.
    - `appPackage`: The app icons in the `appPackage` folder. The icons are `color.png` and `outline.png`.
    - `manifest.source.json`: The app manifest for publishing to the Developer Portal for Teams in `manifest.source.json`.
    - `settings.json`: The app settings, which you selected during project creation, in `settings.json`.
    - The code for the Tab capability in the `Tabs` folder. Some of the important files in this folder are:

      - `tabs/src/index.jsx` is the front-end app's entry point, where the main `App` component is rendered with `ReactDOM.render()`.
      - `tabs/src/components/App.jsx` handles URL routing in the app. It calls the [Microsoft Teams JavaScript client SDK](../msteams-platform/tabs/how-to/using-teams-client-sdk.md) to establish communication between the app and Teams.
      - `tabs/src/components/Tab.jsx` contains the code to implement the UI of your app.
      - `tabs/src/components/TabConfig.jsx` contains the code to implement the UI that configures your app.
      - This folder also holds the code for tabs needed at runtime. Some of them are the privacy notice, terms of use, and configuration tabs.

    When you add the cloud functionality, Teams Toolkit adds the necessary folders to the project. The `api` folder holds the code to any Azure Functions you write.

- title: Build and run your first tab app

    1. Sign in to Microsoft 365 with the TeamsFx CLI:

        ``` bash
        teamsfx account login m365
        ```

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials. Close the browser when you're prompted.

    2. Sign in to Azure with the TeamsFx CLI:

        ``` bash
        teamsfx account login azure
        ```

        Your default web browser opens to let you sign in to the account. Sign in to your Azure account using your credentials. Close the browser when you're prompted.

        The account logins are shared between Visual Studio Code and the TeamsFx CLI.

        Now that the development environment is configured, you can create, build, and deploy your first Teams app.

        <summary>Learn what happens when you run your app locally in the debugger.</summary>

        In case you're wondering, when you press the **F5** key the Teams Toolkit:

        - Registers your app with Azure Active Directory. This app has permissions for the location that the app is loaded from and the backend resources.
        - *Sideloads* the app in Teams.
        - Starts the app's backend running locally using [Azure Function Core Tools](/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?#start).
        - Starts the app's frontend hosted locally.
        - Starts Microsoft Teams in a web browser with a command to instruct Teams to side load the app from `https://localhost:3000/tab`. This URL is registered in the app's manifest.
        - An app manifest is generated and exists in the Developer Portal for Teams. Teams uses the app manifest to tell connected clients where to load the app from.

      You know how to use Toolkit to set up a tab app and run it locally. Next, let’s learn how to build a conversational chat bot with Toolkit!

- title: Create project workspace for your bot app
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    You've built your tab app. Now let's create your first bot app.
    
    The bot capability of a Teams app creates a chatbot or a conversational bot. You use it to run simple and automated tasks, like providing customer service. A bot talks with a web service and helps you use its offerings. You can get weather forecast, make reservations, or any other service offered using a conversational bot.

    :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-bot/your-helloworld-app-bot.png" alt-text="Diagram showing this app has three features. Bot is highlighted." border="false":::
    
    As you've already prepared for creating these apps, you can set up a new Teams project for creating the bot app.

    In this tutorial, you'll learn:

        <summary>Learn what happens when you run your app locally in the debugger.</summary>

        In case you're wondering, when you press the **F5** key, the Teams Toolkit:

        - Registers your app with Azure Active Directory. This app has permissions for the location that the app is loaded from and the backend resources.
        - *Sideloads* the app in Teams.
        - Starts the app's backend running locally using [Azure Function Core Tools](/azure/azure-functions/functions-run-local?#start).
        - Starts the app's frontend hosted locally.
        - Starts Microsoft Teams in a web browser with a command to instruct Teams to side load the app from `https://localhost:3000/tab`. This URL is registered in the app's manifest.
        - An app manifest is generated and exists in the Developer Portal for Teams. Teams uses the app manifest to tell connected clients where to load the app from.

- title: Create project workspace for your message extension app
  durationInMinutes: 1
  content: |

    You've built your bot app. Now, let's create your first message extension app.

    Message Extension capability lets you interact with a web service. Use the compose area, command box, or a message in Teams client to search and initiate actions in an external system.

      :::image type="content" source="~/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/your-helloworld-app-msgext.png" alt-text="Diagram showing this app has three features. Message Extension is highlighted." border="false":::

    There are two types of Teams **messaging extensions**:

    - [Search commands](../msteams-platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/search-commands/define-search-command.md): You can search external systems. Then, you can insert its results into a message in the form of a card.
    - [Action commands](../msteams-platform/messaging-extensions/how-to/action-commands/define-action-command.md): You can present your users with a modal popup to collect or display information. Then, you can process their interaction and send information back to Teams.

    Let's create a message extension app with a *search command*. Use it to search for external data and insert the results into a message within Teams client.

    As you've already prepared for creating these apps, you can set up a new Teams project for creating the message extension app.

    > [!NOTE]
    > Messaging extensions rely on bots to provide a dialog between the user and your code.


    In this tutorial, you'll learn:

    1. [How to set up a new Message Extension project with Teams Toolkit.](#create-your-message-extension-project-workspace)

    ## Take a tour of the source code

    A message extension uses the [Bot Framework](https://docs.botframework.com). You use it to interact with your service via a conversation. After scaffolding is done, view the project directories and files in the Explorer area of Visual Studio Code.

    :::image type="content" source="../msteams-platform/assets/images/teams-toolkit-v2/first-msgext/code-tree.png" alt-text="File layout of a bot project" border="false":::

    - `bot`: The bot code is stored in the `bot` directory.
    - The `bot/messageExtensionBot.js` is the main entry point for the messaging extension.

    > [!Tip]
    > Familiarize yourself with bots and message extension outside of Teams before you integrate your first bot within Teams.  You can find more information about bots by reviewing the [Azure Bot Service](/azure/bot-service/bot-builder-basics?view=azure-bot-service-4.0&preserve-view=true) tutorials.

      <summary>Learn what happens when you deployed your app to Azure</summary>

      Before deployment, the application has been running locally:

      * The backend runs using **Azure Functions Core Tools**.
      * The application HTTP endpoint, where Microsoft Teams loads the application, runs locally.

      Deployment is a two-step process. You provision the resources on an active Azure subscription, and then deploy or upload the backend and frontend code for the application to Azure.

      * The backend, if configured, uses various Azure services, including Azure App Service and Azure Storage.
      * The frontend application will be deployed to an Azure Storage account configured for static web hosting.
